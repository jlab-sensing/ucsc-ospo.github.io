My name is Colleen Josephson, and I research wireless communication and sensing systems, with a focus on how we can leverage sensing for sustainability. I am an Assistant Professor at UC Santa Cruz, and a research scientist at VMware. I also chair the Societal and Economic Needs working group and co-chair the GreenG Working Group within the ATIS NextG Alliance. I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford in 2020. My advisors were Sachin Katti and Keith Winstein.
