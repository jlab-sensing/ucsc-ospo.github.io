### Project Description

Open Sensing Platform (OSP) is a new initiative expanding from our prior project [DirtViz](https://github.com/jlab-sensing/DirtViz), a data visualization web platform for monitoring microbial fuel cell sensors. The mission is to scale up the current platform to support other researchers or citizen scientists in integrating their novel sensing hardware or microbial fuel cell sensors for monitoring and data analysis. Examples of the types of sensors currently deployed are sensors measuring soil moisture, temperature, current, and voltage in outdoor settings. The focus of the software half of the project involves building upon our existing visualization web platform, and adding additional features to support the mission.

### Project Deliverable

- Create a system for remote collaborators/citizen scientists to set up their sensors and upload securely, eg. designing user flow to create sensors
- Craft an intuitive navigation system so that data from deployment sites around the world can be easily viewed, eg. designing experience/system to locate deployment sites.
- Refine our web-based visualization tools to add additional features for users to analyze collected data, eg. lazy loading out-of-range data or caching queried data.
- Document the tool thoroughly for future maintenance
